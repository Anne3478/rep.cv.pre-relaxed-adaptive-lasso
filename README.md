This repository contains the datasets and the R-code used for my thesis project about the topic: Improving Performance of Prediction Rule Ensembles with Relaxed and Adaptive Lasso

In my thesis project I investigated if accuracy, sparsity and stability of prediction rule ensembles can be improved by using the relaxed and/or adaptive lasso for rule selection.
